# xml2bibtex
The Lattes Platform is a online system used by almost all researchers in Brazil to store their curriculum vitae, maintaining an updated Lattes résumé is an eligible precondition for proposal submissions regarding stipends.  It`s pretty common nowadays for a researcher to find themselves using references to other researchers work and BibTeX  is a elegant way to do so. Once the Lattes Platform provide the résumé in XML, it is natural to think that researchers often  browse this largely used system to gather references and desire to easily cite them through BibTeX.  This is the problem this project aims to solve, making as effortless as possible for a researcher to transform an XML résumé containing bibliographical references into a BibTeX file ready to be coupled with LaTeX.
